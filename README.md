# Probabilistic Image Segmentation With Continuous Shape Representations

![Example Image](probabilistic_image_seg.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the Probabilistic Image Segmentation project repository. This repository contains the code and resources for Probabilistic Image Segmentation, a project developed at the Zuse Institute Berlin.


### Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of image segmentation, specifically focusing on scenarios where there are multiple ground truth annotations for a single image, leading to what we refer to as "ambiguous images.". We offer both deterministic and stochastic models for generating image segmentations based on a given ground truth CT image.

### Key Features

With this project, you can:

- **Deterministic Model:** Train and utilize a deterministic model that predicts a single image (or generates one) while offering options to adjust the resolution to suit your needs.

- **Stochastic Model:** Train and use a stochastic model that predicts both mean and covariance, enabling the generation of multiple predictions. Similar to the deterministic model, you can also generate high-resolution images.
